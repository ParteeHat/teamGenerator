# teamGenerator
(Very WIP) team Generator is intended to generate different possible e-sports team compositions based on skill level. You drop in the provided excel sheet (.xlsx) and it sorts the different team compositions based on the gap between skill level. It supports singlular skill levels and multiple skill levels for class based shooter compositions (it was created with Team Fortress 2 in mind).

# To-do
* [x] Create generate combination function
* [x] Associate names with combination values
